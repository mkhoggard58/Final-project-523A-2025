# Final-project-523A-2025
For my final project I decided to take all of my work over the semester and put it into an R markdown. 
The file was a little large so I had to compress it. Please download the Final_project_html_zip file and open it to see my work
you will notice it take a second for it to fully load
once loaded, you can see there are seperate tabs for each lesson we went through.
